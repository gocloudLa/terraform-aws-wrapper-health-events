module_name: Terraform AWS Health Events Module
module_description: The Terraform Wrapper for Health Events captures events from the AWS Health Dashboard, allowing the detection of issues, scheduled changes, and other notifications at the account level. It uses EventBridge rules to capture these events into an SNS and then sends them to a Lambda to process the message.
